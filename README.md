# eCommerce Transactions Dataset - Data Science Assignment

This repository contains the code and deliverables for the eCommerce Transactions Dataset analysis. The dataset consists of customer, product, and transaction data, and the assignment tasks include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and performing Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The `EDA.ipynb` notebook contains the code for performing an extensive analysis of the eCommerce transactions dataset.
- Key tasks in this step include data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations that help derive actionable business insights.

## Lookalike Model
- The `Lookalike.ipynb` notebook presents a Lookalike Model that recommends similar customers based on their profiles and transaction histories.
- The model computes similarity scores and provides recommendations for the top 20 customers.
- The `Lookalike.csv` file contains the output mapping CustomerIDs to their top 3 lookalike customers with similarity scores.

## Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- The `Clustering.ipynb` notebook demonstrates customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.
- The clustering technique used takes both customer profile and transaction data into account, grouping customers into meaningful segments.
- Key clustering metrics such as DB Index are calculated, and the clusters are visualized for interpretation.

## Business Insights
- A PDF report with insights from the exploratory data analysis is included.
- The insights focus on key trends and patterns found in the data, helping to inform business strategy.

## File Naming Convention
All files are named according to the following convention:
